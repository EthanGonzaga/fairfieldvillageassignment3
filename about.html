              <p>The dataset: Country of Birth of person by Year of Arrival in Australia by the ABS provides a detailed insight into Fairfield and its inhabitants.&nbsp;In the given data, it was concluded that Iraqis who arrived between 2011 and 2016 tend to situate around Fairfield. It can be assumed that this is due to the Sydney housing prices. Another factor influencing the movement of migrants depends on where their existing community is located.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Current Issues</h2>
              <p>1. Due to the exponetial increase in Fairfield's refugee population, with an extra 3000 in 2016 (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-02/fairfield-struggles-to-cope-after-increase-in-refugee-arrivals/8145250">source</a>) overpopulation within the area is bound to happen.</p>
              <p>2. Due to the lack of 'open' and 'green' spaces within the redevelopment precinct, safety is a big issue as studies have shown green open spaces reduces crime within the area due to an increased exposure to the public.</p>
              <p>3. As Fairfield's refugee population increases, so does the stigma surrounding them. Due to their 'lower' societal status and origin from a war ravaged country; Fairfield is commonly avoided by those born in Australia.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Solution</h2>
              <p>As a response to these issues plauging the precinct, the idea developed to re-create a section of Fairfield allowed the above issues to be adressed. </p>
              <p>1. Construction of new apartments will flood the Fairfield housing market, resulting in cheaper housing. The allocation of both social and private housing will also bring more cultures into the area.</p>
              <p>2. The central park is a large open multipurpose green space for events and family activities, making Fairfield a safer place.</p>
              <p>3. The introduction of the open space will allow for different cultures to hold festivals as well as a multitude of retail stores and the shopping center will attract different types of people as the low societal status of Fairfield and its residents will be forgotten. </p>
